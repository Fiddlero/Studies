# Studies
I created this projects during my studies at the Cracow University of Technology

## Winter 2017

* "Sorting algorithms":
The program has the possibility of total sorting of numbers, sorting in reverse order, 
sorting (10% in bad positions), no sorting (random data).The program uses:
   * Bubble Sort
   * Bucket Sort
   * Quick Sort
   * Counting Sort
   * Heap Sort
   * Shaker Sort
   
* "Random numbers":
One of the techniques I use in program is the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG).
Second of the techniques is the additive congruential random number generator.
